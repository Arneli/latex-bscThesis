\chapter{Abstract}
This thesis evaluates a pretrained Fully Convolutional Network to segment images into face and non-face region. The result of this segmentation is a binary encoded image. Such a segmentation can be used to limit an algorithm to a specific image region, so that not the entire image has to be scanned by the algorithm. \\ \\
