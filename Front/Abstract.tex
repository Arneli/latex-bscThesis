\chapter{Abstract}

To make a 3D reconstruction of a 2D face, it has to be separated from the background. Often masks are used which determine the facial region. A major problem in finding these masks is partial occlusion. There are several approaches on how to recognise them. A \textit{fitting-algorithm} depends heavily on these masks. It optimises the parameters of a \textit{3D Morphable Model (3DMM)} so that the 3D face looks similar to the depicted face.\\

In this thesis, we use the occlusion-aware face segmentation network proposed by Nirkin et al \cite{nirkin2018_faceswap}. In a first step, we measure the quality of the mask by applying the network to different datasets and occluded facial images whose segmentation is known. Then, multiple fits of the same 2D image are performed, each with a different mask. The resulting fits are compared by their parameters.
