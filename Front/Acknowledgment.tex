\chapter{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank Dr. Adam Kortylewski for his extraordinary support and guidance in this thesis process. He assisted me greatly and was always willing to help me. Thanks to Prof. Dr. Thomas Vetter for his expert advice and the opportunity to write this thesis in his research group.\\

This project would have been impossible without the excellent tutorials of the Gravis group of the University of Basel. These tutorials have made it much easier for me to get started with Scalismo. The results of this work have been generated on the hardware of the Gravis group.
