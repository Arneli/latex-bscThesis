The point cloud is approximated by a quadratic function via a least squares fit (red curve / $f(x)$). The first parameter of this function determines the opening angle ($p_1$). From these graphs we can conclude that the roll angle is the most relevant for the FCN. The pitch-angle is less important and that the accuracy of the FCN is still good even with hith angles (least important). In the bottom row the colors indicate the segmentation accuracy. The brighter the color, the better the segmentation. In every plot, there is a cluster of high accuracy segmentations centered in the origin. The angle on whose axis the cluster has the lesser extent is the more important of the two. We call an angle important, when a small change of this angle leads to a failure of the FCN. }}{10}{figure.28}}
